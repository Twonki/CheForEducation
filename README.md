# CheForEducation

Hey there! 

welcome to my repository for the *Che for free and easy Education* Paper, later renamed to *Theoretical evaluation of the potential advantages of cloud IDEs for research and didactics - on the example of Eclipse Che

 Oof, that´s a long one isn´t it? 
 
 You may find it in the proceedings of the **SKILL 2019**, you may reach out to me for a copy. 
 
 ## Summary
 
 The primary content is, that with cloud based IDE´s not only the code, but also the environment is reproducible. 
 
 The Benefits are threefold:
 - Better reproducible research and experiments
 - Supportive Functions for teachers
 - Access to modern IDE and resources for less blessed people
 
 After a short explanation what a cloud IDE is in general, I discuss and elaborite the above benefits. 
 
 ## Abstract
 
Eclipse Che is a open source cloud-based IDE, inheriting the approach of building cloud native software within a 
remote environment. 
Instead of developing on a local machine, a remote development-server is accessed via web-browser 
and the artifacts are compiled into docker-containers. 

This paper shortly summarizes the required environment, introduces the concept and workflow of Eclipse Che and evaluates 
the benefits and downsides of this approach. 
Focus is set on a new point of view, enhancing computer studies and 
programming classes with this technology.
